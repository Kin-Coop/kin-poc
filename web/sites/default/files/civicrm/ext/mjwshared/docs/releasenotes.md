## Information

Releases use the following numbering system:
**{major}.{minor}.{incremental}**

* major: Major refactoring or rewrite - make sure you read and test very carefully!
* minor: Breaking change in some circumstances, or a new feature. Read carefully and make sure you understand the impact of the change.
* incremental: A "safe" change / improvement. Should *always* be safe to upgrade.

* **[BC]**: Items marked with [BC] indicate a breaking change that will require updates to your code if you are using that code in your extension.

* Fix [#6](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/issues/6) Install error on 0.9.7.

* Fix Failed->Completed for `updateContributionCompleted()` (you now need to pass in `contribution_status_id` as a parameter).
* Fix issues with params for Contribution.repeattransaction and IPNs (wrong params were being passed causing issues with completing contributions and duplicate payments).
* Check if we've already loaded CRM.payment library and don't reload if we have.

#### CRM.payment library

* Load crm.payment.js before any payment processor scripts. Loaded in `page-header` unless client is webform-civicrm when we load in `billing-block`.
* Add getIsRecur() function.
* Allow the client to override/define their own CRM.payment.getTotalAmount() function (currently used by webform_civicrm - see https://github.com/colemanw/webform_civicrm/pull/331).

#### Shared PHP libraries (MjwTrait and MjwIPNTrait)

* **[BC]** Convert beginDoPayment and getRecurringContributionId now require a `\Civi\Payment\PropertyBag` object instead of an array as parameter.

* Enhance getErrorUrl function and fixes for CiviCRM 5.27+

* Switch to contribution.repeattransaction and payment.create API functions.
* Initial support for \Civi\Payment\PropertyBag. Add new CRM.payment library. Add WebhookTrait

## Release 0.7

* Implement buildAsset hook so that assets can be loaded via AssetBuilder without the [minifier](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/minifier) extension being available.
* Recommend minifier extension (and implement a dummy buildAsset hook so extensions using buildAsset for the minifier will still work without it).
* Recommend contributiontransactlegacy extension if drupal webform_civicrm is enabled.
* Implements setExceptionMode to allow skipping the exit on exception policy [!5](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/mjwshared/-/merge_requests/5).
* Add compat functions to work around issues with `\Civi::resources()->addVars()` - This improves compatibility for forms with multiple payment processors.

## Release 0.4

* Fix issue with non-default currency on form when you can choose from more than one payment processor on the form.
* Add `getTokenParameter()`/`setTokenParameter()` functions to MJWTrait which should be used when setting parameters
via javascript (eg. Stripe `paymentIntentID`) which are required when the payment is actually processed (via `doPayment()`).

## Release 0.3

* Major refactor of MJWIPNTrait.
* Add function to update the transaction ID for a payment related to a contribution.
